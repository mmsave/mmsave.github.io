The **ecommerce equation** is a proven formula that determines how profitable an online business can be:

### **Ecommerce Success = (Traffic √ó Conversion Rate √ó Average Order Value) - Costs**

- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The average amount spent per transaction.
- **Costs**: Expenses related to marketing, fulfillment, and operations.

By optimizing each of these factors, you can **increase revenue and improve profitability** in 2025.
