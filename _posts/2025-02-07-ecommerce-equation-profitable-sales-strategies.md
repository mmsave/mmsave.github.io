- Optimize product pages with detailed descriptions, images, and meta tags.
- Create informative blog content to attract organic traffic.

### **Paid Advertising**
- Use Google Ads and Facebook Ads to target potential buyers.
- Implement retargeting campaigns to bring back lost visitors.
- Test different ad creatives and landing pages to improve ROI.

### **Social Media Marketing**
- Build an engaged audience on Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest.
- Partner with influencers in your niche to expand reach.
- Utilize shoppable posts and direct checkout features.

### **Email Marketing & Content Marketing**
